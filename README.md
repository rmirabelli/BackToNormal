###BackToNormal

A celebration of a return to normalcy
* Everyone has their markers of what the world "should" look like when it returns to normal
* For me, it's tracking upcoming concerts, shows, and travel
* A TodayWidget that reminds me about what's coming up would be awesome
--
* Build phases
        * create an input screen
        * use the date selector and highlight its best use
        * create two viewers, one small one large
        * make widget that reads data & displays
        * see if today widget translates to M1 today center
