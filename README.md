###BackToNormal

A celebration of a return to normalcy
    * Everyone has their markers of what the world "should" look like when it returns to normal
    * For me, it's tracking upcoming concerts, shows, and travel
    * A TodayWidget that reminds me about what's coming up would be awesome
-- CURRENT APP STATE
    * Hardcoded list of dates (I *think* they're right)
    * app displays tableview
-- TODO (WIDGET)
    * create two viewers, one small one large
    * make widget that reads data & displays
    * see if today widget translates to M1 today center
-- TODO (APP)
        * create an input screen
        * use the date selector and highlight its best use
